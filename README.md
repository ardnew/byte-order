# `byte-order`

This library is implemented using only C++ header files containing fully `constexpr`-compatible methods.

Standard C++17 or newer is required.

### Purpose

Types and methods are provided to enable compile-time and run-time reversal of the underlying byte representation in values of arbitrary integral type.

This project was intended for use with device drivers written for PlatformIO ([example](examples/platformio)).
